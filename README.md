### Hi there, I'm Tong Ha

## A little about Me.
- $(find-collapsed) Hello! I'm Tong Ha, a Computer Science student.

I enjoy creating creative things for Windows, Mobile, and Internet platform. My goal is using my knowledge to make my ideas come true and also performance experiences.

Moreover, learning new technologies is what I am passion about (I self-taught Java and C# for couple years). I enjoy working in group because the best way to learn thing is from friends and teammates. I also like helping other and reviewing code for other teammates.
